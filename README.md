# SQL

A project for learning the basics of **Structured Query Language**. My purpose is to learn to use **SQL** in a way that is applicable to real-life projects and work.

## Software Installation and Setup

First I need to install the prerequisites so I can get this project up and running. I just bought a second-hand **Lenovo Legion T5** PC that is running **Microsoft Windows 11 Home**, so performance shouldn't be an issue.

I'm going to use **PostgreSQL** because it is highly recommended and applicable to real-world jobs. I go to https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/, select **Download the installer**, and download the latest (**18.1**) version for **Windows x86-64**. I run the installation file as administrator. I use the default setups and set a password when prompted **for the database superuser**, leave the default **Port** number, select **fi-FI** as the **Locale** (tells your computer or program how to handle language-specific stuff)
